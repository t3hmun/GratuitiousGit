# GratuitiousGit
Background python script to agressively commit changes and push them on a timer. 

## What it will do
* Watch project folder.
* Commit on every file change on a special autocommit branch.
* Automatically rolls up automatic-commits when user wants to manually commit.
* Automatically pushes on a timer.

## What it wont do
Pull

## Why
I'm planning on using this to add auto-save and push functionality to Zim-Wiki on windows.

Also be useful for making freshly written impulsively deleted code recpverable.

## Current Status
Planning (29/06/2015).

## Requirements
Built and tested on:
Python 3.4, Windows 7, git 1.9.5
